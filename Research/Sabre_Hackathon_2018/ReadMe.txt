In a group setup of Technical Product Managers (at that time I was an individual contributor TPM) we won 4000 PLN in category - Business Ideas with a documented use of Profile data, air extras sales data, air extras offers generation in combination with ML from Microsoft Azure.
The idea included several products in Air Offers area: Customer Insight, Ancillaries/Air Extras, Inventory, Dynamic Retailer

The purpose of the busines case was to be able to propose up-sell and cross sell of air-extras to people who fly on certain routes and often buy air extras.

One group of customers was frequent fliers and offering them items that they always or often buy - to make it easier for them to buy some items again.

Second group of customers was a group of people similar to customers who already bought someting on a particular route and because of similarity criteria ML was about to return the probability of them buying same item(s).
