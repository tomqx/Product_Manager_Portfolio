I have attended GCP instructor led training where we have explored possibilities of BigQuery functionality on publicly available models.

Models were: 
- Bike rentals data
- Weather data (rainfall)

Result
- As a result we got to a point where results showed correlation between amount of rain and bicycle rentals

Outcome:
- It was possible to practice use of dataset loading and querying
