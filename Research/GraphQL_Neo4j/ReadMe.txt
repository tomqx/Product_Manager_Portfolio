I have used Neo4j GraphQL language in a sandbox environment in order to create a structure of Products in Product Verticals in Sabre.

For that purpose I have:
- contacted HR team to provide list of products 
- used internal documentation to build relations between products in an XLS
- used XLS import in Neo4j environment to create instances of products and their relations

Use of the work product:
- dynamic and "swimming" structure of products could be displayed for everyone inside company
- structure could be projected on a wall during company events or while new joiners had their introduction days

Disclaimer
I cannot provide real graph of products as this is Sabre confidential data.
